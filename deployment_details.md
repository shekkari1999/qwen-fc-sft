I want a nice chat like interface with all the nerd detail options enabled like tokens/sec and other creatice stuff. 
I want an option to select from which stage of model we are inferencing. is it stage 1 or stage 2 or stage 3 
keep the list of available tools on the side bar in the UI.
go creative in the UI, should look classy
Also i would like to deploy it using runpod vllm
Also once look at the available tools and see if our model has access to them.
